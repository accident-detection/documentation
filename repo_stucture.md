Repository structure
=====================

What every repo should have:

* ```lib/```

In this folder you place all libraries that you use in your module.

* ```src/```

In this folder you will place all source files for your module

* ```LICENSE```

Every repo should have an MIT license file. The license will be with your name
and this year (2015.).

* ```README.md```

In this file you will place any usage informations, dependencies, or build
information.

* ```.gitignore```

In this file you will place any files that are not needed for building the module.
